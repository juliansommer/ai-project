# Wikipedia Data Scraping and Graph Creation

This project was created as part of the 2023 Peregian Digital Hub Cadetship program. Due to number of changes made to LangChain since creation, it is no longer functional and requires most things to be rewritten.

## Installation Requirements

To get started with this project, you'll need to install the following Python packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install bs4, chainlit, duckduckgo-search, langchain, langchain_community, langchain_experimental, langchain_openai, pandas, wikipedia
```

### Note

Even fresh installs of LangChain can miss some imports. To ensure you have all the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install --upgrade langchain
```

### Running File

In the folder

```bash
python -m chainlit run app.py
